# Engineering Conventions for Jupyter Notebooks

Notebooks are great!
I love the way notebooks encourage transparency and incremental working.
But the software engineer in me struggles with how disconnected the research notebooks are from production algorithm usage;
the hard won lessons of TDD/BDD CI/CD in the commecrial software world don't seem to have percolated back into the acedemia dominated data science space.

So I wanted to come up with some conventions that maximise the benefits of the notebook working environment while at the same time making that work more durable and accessible.

## Goals

* **Minimal impact on the creative/research process**
* No re-code/re-package to deploy algorithms
* Good separation of concerns for data science, engineering and OPS
* Support repeatable testing and reproducible results
* Single source repo, library appoach
* Merge support
