# Engineering Conventions for Notebooks

Notebooks are great!
As a long time fan of BDD Gherkin 

## Goals

* **Minimal impact on the creative process**
* No re-code/re-package to deploy algorithms
* Good separation of concerns for data science, engineering and OPS
* Support repeatable testing and reproducible results
* Single source repo, library appoach
